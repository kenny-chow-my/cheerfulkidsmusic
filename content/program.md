Music for Little Mozarts is a piano and music curriculum designed for children ages 4-6. This premier piano education provides a balance between the discipline necessary for playing the piano and enjoyment one receives from the process of music making. Children will learn new concepts such as keyboard performance, pitch matching, rhythm, and keyboard technique. Children will work on musical expressiveness related to tempo, dynamics, mood, and articulation. This program introduces children to compositions by major composers throughout the history of music such as Mozart, Bach, Beethoven, etc.

Our Music Appreciation program uses modern techniques with a play-based approach so that your child can rapidly learn the fundamentals and experience the joy of music.
This program is your child's first step to building strong musical foundation through singing, story-telling, percussion instruments playing, games, and movement. Children will learn basics such as singing & solfege (do, re, mi, etc.), rhythm, beats, dynamics, tempo and various aspects of the musical world. On top of that, children will get their hands on percussion instruments such as shakers, triangle, drums, tambourine, resonator bells and more.
