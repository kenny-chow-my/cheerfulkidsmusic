Many early childhood experts agree that music is an integral part of learning and development in a childâ€™s growing age. Our programs use modern techniques with a play-based approach so that your child can rapidly learn the fundamentals and experience the joy of music.

#### Music sparks joy and an outlet for creative expression; it helps develop listening; it contributes to motor skill development (both fine and gross motor skills); and it increases the range and flexibility of the voice.
